      "Claudio is a very attentive to details hoster. We went during Rock in Rio and he was 100% available to help. He looked and showed us where we could get transportation, market and places to go in Barra. Communication with him was very simple and always very available. Regarding the aparthotel, he delivered exactly as it is in the ad. Newly renovated apartment with all impeccable furniture, bed, sofa, table and a full kitchen to cook your own meals and enjoy the apartment. In addition, the bathroom and the apartment were impeccably clean, making all the difference. There is even a parking space available inside the building. Regarding the structure of the condominium, unfortunately we were not able to enjoy it, but for a short walk we loved the location of the pool with a beautiful view of the beach. I recommend it 100% and I don't have any negative points about this (Website hidden by Airbnb) we will definitely come back with more calm.",
