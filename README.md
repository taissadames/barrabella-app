# Welcome to the BarraBella Airbnb!

This is the final project of the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive. It was developped by myself in a time frame of 3.5 days.
No minimum requirements for this project, we were able to choose the theme and where to build it.

## :page_facing_up: About
For my final project, I decided to create a "real life" application to use on my Portfolio. I developed a front-end wep app using React for my clients (my parents). 
They have an investment property in a tourist city that they manage through Airbnb.
I decided to make a website for their property with the goal of atracting more guests.

## :pencil2: Planning & Problem Solving
- The first step was to talk to my clients and understand exactly what they needed in their website.
- Then, I wrote a list of requests (necessary deliveries, color palette, images, features, map, contact form)
- I started working on the easier ones first. I started creating the app whithout any functionalities, just so they could see how it would be.
- Then, I added Tailwind CSS.
- After that, I started going through the more complex (for me) functionalities, like the Google Maps and the Contact Form (which I used EmailJS).
- Last step was to try to make a multilingual app using I18Next.

## :rocket: Cool tech
- React.
- Tailwind CSS.
- Google Map generator.
- EmailJS.
- Surge for Front End deployment.
- Responsive design & mobile-friendly.

## :scream: Bugs to fix :poop:
- Translate buttons partially working.

## :sob: Lessons learnt
- Well, I learnt that if you leave the most complex item for the end, you may not finish it on time...

## :white_check_mark: Future features
- Definitely make the translating buttons work for all the texts.
- After that, I plan to make the app into a full stack app, like a CRUD app. This was asked by my dad, so he could login as an Admin and make changes to the website himself.
- I also plan to add Google Analytics so we can keep track of where the visitors come from.

## Thank you for visiting :)
