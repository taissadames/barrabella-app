Let's go to the Park is an app focused in displaying information about the parks in South Australia.
The user can check all relevant informations about the parks, such as: address, facilities, parking, prices, if it's pet friendly, etc.
On the Home Page, the user can either log in or sign up to be able to see the app content.
Only registered users are able to edit and add new parks.
